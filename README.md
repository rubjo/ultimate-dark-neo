# Ultimate Dark Neo

My second take on the ultimate dark colour theme/scheme for code (main focus: finding pleasant settings for HTML/CSS/JS).

Based on Sublime Text's built-in Mariana scheme and kkga's Spacegray (https://github.com/kkga/spacegray)

#### Manually

You can also install the theme manually:

3. Copy the folder into `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
